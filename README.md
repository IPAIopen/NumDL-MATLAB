# NumDL-MATLAB

These MATLAB codes can be used to reproduce and extend the examples in the  [Numerical Methods for Deep Learning](https://github.com/IPAIopen/NumDL-CourseNotes) class.

These materials was first developed by [Lars Ruthotto](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~lruthot/) at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu) and [Eldad Haber](https://sites.google.com/site/ehaberubc/home) at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in the Spring and Summer of 2018. 

## Scope 

The MATLAB files here aim at implementing of neural networks and numerical methods for their training in the simplest possible way. This is critical here, in order to involve students and researchers from a variety of backgrounds. It is more important to us than speed in this case. In fact, many functions here can be optimized for runtime but often at the cost of less readability.
